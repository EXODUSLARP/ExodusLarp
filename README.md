Download & Install: Grab ExodusLarp from our secure drop (link in bio – always scan for fun, not funds). It's a quick, standalone EXE for Windows/Mac – no blockchain drama, just pure pixel magic.




Launch and Sneak In: Fire it up alongside your real Exodus wallet. It'll auto-sync with your local files, no API keys or wallet unlocks required. Keep it casual – it's all client-side sleight of hand.

Customize Your Mirage: Hit that sneaky settings icon (the little gear in the corner, winking at you). Boom – a clean dashboard unfolds. Scroll to any asset (BTC, ETH, your grandma's meme coin), crank the slider or punch in your wildest number, and hit "Render Riches." Watch your portfolio balloon in real-time previews. Export screenshots, share to socials, or loop it back into Exodus for that ultra-convincing demo.



Why ExodusLarp is better than other cracked softwares in exodus

Zero Risk, All Reward: This isn't hacking – it's harmless HUD tweaking. Your real funds stay untouched; it's like Photoshop for portfolios. No seeds compromised, no chains forked.
